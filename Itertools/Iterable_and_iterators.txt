# Iterable and Iterators

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from itertools import combinations

N = int(input())

Hints:
The filter() method filters the given sequence with the help of a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not. syntax: filter(function, sequence) Parameters: function: function that tests if each element of a sequence true or not.
