# The captains room

explanation:-
Create two empty sets. For each array element, if it isn't in the first one, add it to the first - otherwise, add it to the second.
The difference between the two will be the captain's room.


# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
d=input();  #get rid of first line 
a=input().split();  #store all to array
s1=set();  #all unique room number
s2=set();  #all unique room number occur more than once
for i in a:
    if  i in s1:
        s2.add(i);
    else:
        s1.add(i);
s3=s1.difference(s2);
print (list(s3)[0])


# Enter your code here.
K = int(input())
rooms = input().split()

rooms.sort()
capt_room = (set(rooms[0::2]) ^ set(rooms[1::2]))
print(capt_room.pop())
