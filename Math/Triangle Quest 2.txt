Demlo numbers
The output requires the sequence of Demlo numbers. For n<=9, the squares of the first few repunits are precisely the Demlo numbers. Example: 1^2=1, 11^2=121, 111^2=12321 and so on.

At first lets see how to get repunits. (10^i - 1) / 9 results in the repunits sequence: 1, 11, 111 etc.

Then calculating square of each repunits, we can get Demlo numbers.

So, the code to perform these operations to generate Demlo numbers is:

for i in range(1,int(raw_input())+1): 
    print(((10**i)/9)**2)
