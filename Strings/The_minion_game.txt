explanation:-

Consider the example given in hacker rank itself: string = 'BANANA'
len(string) = 6
so,
for start_idx in range(length):
score = length - start_idx
if string[start_idx] in vowels:
Kevin_score += score
else:
Stuart_score += score
When start_idx = 0
score = len(string) - start_idx which means score = 6-0, implies the we can make total of 6 words with the starting letter "B" such as "B", "BA", "BAN", "BANA", "BANAN" and "BANANA" . The score value will be moved to Stuart_SCORE.

when start_idx = 1
score = len(string) - start_idx which means score = 6-1, implies the we can make total of 5 words with the starting letter "A" such as "A", "AN", "ANA", "ANAN" and "ANANA" . here ieh score will be moved to KEVIN_SCORE
